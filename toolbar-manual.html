    <p>The toolbar boasts numerous fun settings to give the visitor the ability to alter the page to their needs.</p>
    <p>The settings include buttons to change the background color, as well as scroll assist buttons.</p>
    <p>The buttons pressed are not kept track of, and the user can only use one function at a time.</p>
    <p>In order to reverse the settings applied by a button, the user  must press the button again to reset the background to the original state (defined by a default background)</p>
    <p>The scroll assist buttons are one-way, so no need to press them again. The user can still use them multiple times.</p>
    <p>The toolbar also has a Return to Top clicktext, however there is no point in using a Scroll to Bottom clicktext.</p>
    <footer>More functions to be implemented later.</footer>
